## 📘 Abstract

With the rising global energy demands and the urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, ocean wave energy presents a promising renewable alternative. Ocean waves possess one of the highest energy densities among all renewable sources. This project explores the **feasibility, technology, benefits, and challenges** of converting wave motion into clean electricity.

- 🌐 Global wave energy potential: 2 Terawatts (TW) annually
- 🇮🇳 India’s coastline: ~7500 km with ~14 kW/m average wave power potential
- 🔋 A 10% utilization could generate over 7500 MW of clean energy

## ⚡ How It Works

Waves transfer mechanical motion to a **converter mechanism** like:
- **Buoys** or **Panels** that move with wave motion  
- Transducers (Hydraulic, Mechanical, Electromagnetic)  
- **Linear Permanent Magnet Generators** or **Turbines**  
- Stored or transmitted to grid via subsea cables

## 📈 Benefits

- ✅ Clean & Carbon-Free  
- ✅ Renewable & Reliable  
- ✅ High Energy Output  
- ✅ Minimal Visual/Noise Impact  
- ✅ Long Operational Lifespan (~25 years)  
- ✅ Economic Boost for Coastal Areas
